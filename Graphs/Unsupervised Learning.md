## 1.Towards Unsupervised Deep Structure Learning (WWW'22)

Important Referrences : Deep Graph Structure Learning(GSL)

1. Most GNNs rely on fundamental assumption that the original structure is credible enought o be viewed as a ground-truth for model training.
2. Parametasize the adjacency matrix with probabilistic models and jointly train on downstream tasks.
